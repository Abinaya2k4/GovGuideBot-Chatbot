Accessing information about government schemes can often be a challenge for 
citizens due to complexities in navigating the official websites, long waiting time 
for assistance, and limited availability of resources. This lack of accessibility may 
lead to underutilization of beneficial schemes. Additionally, government agencies 
may face a burden in managing inquiries and applications efficiently, resulting in 
delays and inefficiencies in service delivery. Thus, our project is a solution 
that can provide seamless and personalized assistance to individuals seeking 
information about government schemes.
